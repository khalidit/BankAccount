## Bank Account operations

Here we will find 3 possible operations on a bank account.
such as : 
 - deposit operation
 - withdrawal operation
 - retreive all operations history

To do that, i have followed the TDD method.
In #src/test folder you will find all use cases tests, and in #src/main the service API (IBankAccountService) and its underlying implementation (BankAccountServiceImpl).
